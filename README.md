# Cult of Done

[Original post](https://manifestos.mombartz.com/the-cult-of-done/)

The Cult of Done is a philosophy born from the intersection of creativity and productivity. Created by Bre Pettis and Kio Stark in 2009, it's a 13-point manifesto that champions action over perfection, embracing mistakes as progress, and valuing completion over endless refinement.

The core message is radically simple: doing beats planning. It encourages creators to fight perfectionism, procrastination, and endless revision cycles by focusing on getting things done. The manifesto became a rallying cry for makers, artists, and entrepreneurs who needed permission to launch imperfect work and iterate quickly.

What makes it powerful is its honesty about the creative process - acknowledging that chaos, mistakes, and "fake it till you make it" are all valid parts of making things happen. It's not about lowering standards, but about redirecting energy from overthinking to actual creation.
